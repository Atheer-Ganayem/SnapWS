**SnapWS is a minimal WebSocket library for Go.**

It takes care of ping/pong, close frames, connection safety, and lifecycle management so you can just connect, read, and write â€” without boilerplate or extra complexity.

> ðŸš§ **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** ðŸš§  
> This library is not yet production-ready. Expect breaking changes as development continues.

> ðŸ§  **Why?**  
> Using [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) often felt like overkill. You had to write a lot of code, worry about race conditions, manually handle timeouts, and understand the WebSocket protocol more deeply than necessary.
>
> `snapws` handles the boring stuff for you â€” so you can **just send and receive messages**.
