#### IDEA ####

- i should always read from the connection, so i listen to control frames.
  right now im only listening to anything (control frames or not), only if the
  user calls any of my read messages. However, i should always listen for incoming messages.
  a way of implementing this, is firstly to make a listener go routine, and to have an
  inbound buffered channel, where i send to it only non-control frames, i send them in a form 
  of frame-group.
  when the user calls any of the public api methods, i should read from the ibnound in return to him.
  if there is a type mismatch, i must return it.

#### END #####


- TESTS
- maybe add an atomic counter for conns len
