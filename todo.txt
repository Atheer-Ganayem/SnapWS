### important fix ###
-- BUG: im not accepting the full frame if its a close from, im accessing payload on a nil pointer

- Handling close in readString/json/bytes

- consider validating utf-8 when receiving the frame, not in the readString\JSON

- accepting reserved frames. READ MORE ABOUT EXTENSTIONS
### END ###

- the accept frame function looks ugly
- TESTS AND COMMENTS
- maybe add an atomic counter for conns len
- add middlewres
- maybe add rate limiting
